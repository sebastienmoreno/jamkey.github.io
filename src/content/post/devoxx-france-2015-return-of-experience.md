# Devoxx France 2015 return of experience

**Devoxx France** is a conference for developers which took place in Paris during 3 days in April 2015.

As explained by the Devoxx team, the goal of Devoxx is :

> To provide a technological conference of quality,  
> where the enthusiastics developers can come to learn,  
> work in network, to hack code, to make monitoring,  
> and to come to be inspired during 3 days.

Summary quoted from Oracle website:

> In this 20th year of Java, the theme of Devoxx France 2015 was about innovations in technology over the next 20 years.  
> In his keynote, Java architect Brian Goetz described a development approach that keeps up with the technical needs of developers.  
> Java 9 will deliver a modular platform tuned to hardware requirements.  
> CEO Quentin Adam of Clever Cloud considers that engineering roles are entering an age of specialization.  
> Dan Allen, an open source advocate, author, and world renowned speaker, discussed the responsibility of developers to preserve digital information for future generations.

## Conclusion


![Alt text](/public/images/devoxx/devoxx-pic3.png)

Devoxx is a motivating experience, specially when you are asking yourself question on the IT vision to adopt.

-   New orientations are spreading:
    -   Cloud oriented development is clearly a global shared vision
    -   Microservices architecture will be associated to Cloud orientation
    -   Fast development (Spring Boot, Jhipster, Javascript full stack) is mandatory to time to market innovations
-   New IT point of view
    -   DevOps idea is spread on all IT subjects
-   New inspiration
    -   Philosophy : as the quote said « with great power comes great responsabilities »
    -   Robotic : is becoming a real field for IT projects
    -   Learning : how to learn and how « to learn to learn » is becoming a big topic
    -   Responsibility and security :
    -   New way to manage projects : adopt management transparency, step back on received wisdom, agility and impact mapping is not a good choice = it is becoming mandatory
